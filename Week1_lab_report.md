## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

* Since I already knew my password, I didn't have to reset it
* Then I created a new terminal in VSCode, by clicking Terminal > New Terminal on the menu bar
* Next, enter the command ssh cs15lwi23xxx@ieng6.ucsd.edu (where xxx stands for your student specific ID), and press enter
* When asked `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?` I typed in yes
* You should now be logged in!

## Step 3: Try running some commands
* I tried running pwd, ls, cd, mkdir and some basic commands shown below
* `pwd` command shows you the current directory the system is on
* `ls` command lists the files in the current directory
* `cd` command stands for change directory to point the current directory to another location
* `mkdir` command that makes a new directory/subdirectory
