## Step 2: Remotely Connecting

* Since I already knew my password, I didn't have to reset it
* Then I created a new terminal in VSCode
* Entered the command ssh cs15lwi23apw@ieng6.ucsd.edu and pressed enter
* When asked Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? I typed in yes
* You should now be logged in!
